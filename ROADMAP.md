# Roadmap

This roadmap groups backlog items into milestones and defines when scope is frozen.

## Milestones

### M0 — Foundation (Docs + Guardrails)

**Goal:** Establish durable process artifacts (rules, backlog, ADRs, CI guardrails).

**Scope (frozen when started):**

- Governance decision rights (`product_manager/GOVERNANCE.md`)
- Definition of Done and traceability (`product_manager/PROJECT_RULES.md`)
- Backlog/Roadmap/Risks baseline (`BACKLOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `RISKS.md`)
- Decision log + ADR template (`DECISIONS.md`, `docs/adr/`)
- GitHub templates + CI checks (`.github/`)

### M1 — App Scaffolding (TBD)

**Goal:** Bootstrap the application in `app/` following `software_engineer/TECH_STACK.md`.

**Scope:** To be defined once app work begins.

## Change Control

- Once a milestone starts, its scope is frozen per `product_manager/PROJECT_RULES.md`.
- Add new work as new backlog items; do not rewrite in-flight scope.
