# Plan Guardian Agent

This directory contains the documentation for the Plan Guardian Agent.

The Plan Guardian Agent is responsible for monitoring the codebase for changes and ensuring that those changes are reflected in the project plan. This agent is a key component of our Spec-Driven Development (SDD) and Vibe Coding methodologies, as it ensures that the plan remains the single source of truth for the project.
